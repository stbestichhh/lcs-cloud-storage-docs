## About

LCS - is a local cloud storage server. The Local Cloud Storage Server project aims to develop a robust and secure local cloud storage solution. This system will provide users with the ability to store, retrieve, and manage their data locally while enjoying the benefits of cloud storage such as scalability, accessibility, and reliability.

The server will expose a RESTful API that allows users to interact with the storage. This API will support operations such as uploading files, downloading and all default filesystem operations.

In addition to the API, the system will provide a Command Line Interface (CLI). This will enable users to use server feature or to configure it.
